 I am an ecologist, who has worked as environmental consultant on major infrastructure and development projects. I moved to the Institute of Technology Sligo to undertake a pilot on results-based agri-environment payments (www.rbaps.eu) and I currently lecture in Environmental Science and am part of the Centre for Environmental Sustainability and Research (CERIS) group. Together with colleagues in GMIT, I undertake practical research on high nature value farming systems.
