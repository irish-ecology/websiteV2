I am a behavioural ecologist. My research, in collaboration with The Department of Agriculture, Food and The Marine and The National Parks and Wildlife Service, has focussed on the ranging behaviour of European badgers (Meles meles) in Ireland. We have examined the impact of roadworks on badger ranging behaviour, revealed the extent of movement during dispersal and described a previously unrecognised ranging strategy among male badgers. I anticipate that the improved understanding of badger movement ecology in Ireland will be used to inform more efficient and effective TB management strategies, including farm biosecurity and badger vaccine delivery.
